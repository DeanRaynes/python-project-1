Group 3 Challenge (Dean Raynes â€“ Coordinator, Joseph Nieves, Alberto Ramos, Priscilla Miller)

Overview
A Kaggle data set was utilized to analyze fatal accidents in the state of Arizona from 2012-2016. A USAspending.com API was obtained to trace federal monies to the county level. Spending data was analyzed on the per capita level. Risky driving behaviors of speeding, drinking and driving, drowsy driving, and distracted driving were analyzed for the total population and for pedestrian data. Timelines investigating day vs night, and weekday vs weekend driving were analyzed. Visualizations were generated to detail fatal accidents per county by year. Visualization showing number of passengers and whether accidents are more likely to occur on freeways or city streets.
